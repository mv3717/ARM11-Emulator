Welcome to our project!

To compile our emulator and assembler simply make the makefile in the 'src' folder. 
The executable files will be in the 'output' directory for testing convenience.

Or extension is a Haiku poem generator. It will read out on a speaker Haiku's randomly every time the button on our raspberry Pi is pressed. To build it, just make the makefile 
in the 'RaspberryHaiku' directory.
